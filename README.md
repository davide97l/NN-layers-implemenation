# NN-layers-implemenation

## 1 Intro
**MNIST** digits dataset is a widely used dataset for image classiﬁcation in machine learning ﬁeld. It contains 60000 training examples and 100000 testing examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a ﬁxed-size image. Each example is a 784×1 matrix, which is transformed from an original 28×28 grayscale image. Digits in MNIST range from 0 to 9. Some examples are shown below.

In this project, have been built a **Softmax Classiﬁer** and a **Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)** to perform MNIST classiﬁcation respectively.

## 2 Softmax for MNIST Classiﬁcation

### 2.1 FilesDescription 
- **softmax.ipynb** is an IPython Notebook ﬁle which describes the main contents of this project. Data loading, hyerparameters setting, training and testing are included in this ﬁle.
- **mnist_data_loader.py** is used to load MNIST dataset.
- **softmax_classiﬁer.py** describes the softmax classiﬁer.

## 3 MLP for MNIST Classiﬁcation

### 3.1 FilesDescription 
- **MLP.ipynb** describes the main contents of this project.
- **network.py** describes network class, which can be utilized when deﬁning network architecture and performing model training.
- **optimizer.py** describes SGD optimizer class, which can be used to perform forward and backward propagation.
- **solver.py** describes training and testing pipeline.
- **plot.py** describes plot_loss_and_acc function which can be used to plot curves of loss and accuracy. 

In addition, there are several layers deﬁned in criterion/ and layers/. Our implementation is guided by modularity idea. Each layer class has three methods: __init__, forward and backward. __init__ method is used to deﬁne and initialize some parameters. forward and backward are used to perform forward and backward propagation respectively. 
- **FCLayer** treats each input as a simple column vector (need to reshape if necessary) and produces an output vector by doing matrix multiplication with weights and then adding biases: u = Wx + b.
- **SigmoidLayer** is a sigmoid activation unit, computing the output as f(u) = 1/(1+exp(−u)).
- **ReLULayeris** is a linear rectiﬁed unit, computing the output as f(u) = max(0,u). 
- **EuclideanLossLayer** computes the sum of squares of differences between inputs and label.
- **SoftmaxCrossEntropyLossLayer** can be viewed as a mapping from input to a probability distribution.
